  <h2>About</h2>
  
  <p>
    The purpose of this inventory is to increase the use of sophisticated research
    equipment in our region by connecting potential users with the facilities that
    host the equipment.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The database includes brief descriptions of major pieces of
    research equipment available for use by external researchers, as well as contact
    information for you to connect directly with the host.    
  </p>
    
  <p>
    We hope this information will provide a starting point for the development of
    partnerships, regionally, nationally, and internationally.
